// this is a basic data file for housing all the props data
// that you will pass into this component. By default, loris has
// setup a "data" object for you. You should import it in the file 
// where you consume this component and then pass it to the relevant 
// component like this: {...data}
//
// you can also add and export as many other objects from this file
// as you like, this is a pattern we encourage. So if you had an instance
// of this component on the homepage, setup and export a "homepage" object
// and then an "aboutpage" object etc (or use whatever naming convention
// you like!)
