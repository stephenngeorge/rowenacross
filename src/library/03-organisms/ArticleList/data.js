    articleSummary: "My life before Christ was small yet looked full. Now my life in Christ is full but the world may describe it as small as it is focused solely on Him.",
    bodyText: "My life before Christ was small yet looked full. Now my life in Christ is full but the world may describe it as small as it is focused solely on Him.\n\nI was loved by my 2 high achieving, hardworking parents as I grew up. But something in me lacked.  I searched for the thing I lacked in all the wrong places.  Mainly in inappropriate relationships with boys. Calling them relationships would be generous!  I always pursued very beautiful boys who only had room for one love in their life – them!\nI desperately searched for my identity in how loved I was by men and people in general if I am honest!  If someone liked me – then I was happy.  If they didn't then I wasn't.  I was a huge people pleaser and took all my esteem from other peoples opinions of me. This is of course a very dangerous thing to do as it gives other people a kind of power over you that no-one should have. Ruthless people will take advantage of this.\nOn the outside I was outgoing and the life and soul of the party but on the inside I felt hollow.  I couldn't articulate these feelings as I stayed away from deep feelings. Something I must have learned in childhood – I genuinely have no idea why.\n\nBut my vulnerability was easy to spot in predatory people.  I was assaulted on the tube twice and if there was unstable person within 500 miles they would gravitate towards me!\nA hedonistic party lifestyle seemed the answer. This is pre Instagram days - but look how much fun we look like we are having by the world's standards.  I kept the debilitating panic attacks to myself.  My high achieving self climbed the career ladder quickly and I was a director in a marketing agency by the time I was 26! Giving a 26 year old that much money really doesn't help.  My liberal upbringing meant I had no boundaries – no moral framework.  Now don't get me wrong my mum and dad taught me right from wrong and indeed taught me to stand up for those who can't stand up for themselves. So you can add opinionated to the description of me in my twenties.\n\nThings started to change when I got together with Ron.  He had always been my friend in our friendship group who loved to party.  We got married in a church and I remember us not even considering getting married anywhere else.  We said that it was only real if it was in a church.  Which is bizarre considering we had never really been to church and neither had our families at that point!!!!!.  What I have also never forgotten was how kind the Vicar/Pastor was to us.  He didn't judge us he just said \"this is the first step to you knowing God. You may not take the next step for years to come but that is ok\". First seed planted, unbeknown to us, by that loving man. You see when you look back you realise God has been with you always and gone way ahead of you.  But for me my beloved Ron was one of the only people in the world who really knew me and loved me just as I was.\nBut he too felt that ache.  We both started to talk about how there really must be more to life than this! Just work, eat, rave repeat!\nSo we started to look for the answer to that hole in us but we didn't know any Christians (or anyone of any faith if I am honest) you don't tend to find them at a rave! So we just looked in the bookshop and found a book called the celestine prophecy.  Not great!!!! But it lead us to see life was bigger than us and that there was no such thing as co-incidence. No idea what else it said but it didn't point us to Jesus.\nWe then decided to have a baby. Simple enough, millions of people do it why not us?  During pregnancy (which took over a year to achieve – turns out its not as easy to get pregnant as you think!) I had a deep fear of giving birth. They had no idea why I just did.\nFinally a kind midwife heard my fears and understood instead of telling me off. If one more midwife had told me \"millions of people give birth every day\". I may have done something very hormonal and wrong to them! She decided to induce me in hospital so I would feel safe. After many hours I decided to go home because the final of pop idol was on and I wanted to see who won (yes my priorities were super highbrow at that point! It was Will Young in case you are interested!).\nAt about 4am I was awoken by a sharp kick to my back and I was shaking from head to toe. I still believe my daughter woke me up to tell me we were in trouble.\nWe went to hospital and they found I had a high fever.  So they gave me paracetamol to bring it down and called the doctor and anaesthetist. I had an epidural and penicillin both pumped into my body and that is when it went horribly wrong. My body started to convulse and they started to panic. I had a major allergic reaction to one of the drugs. I couldn't breathe or speak but I could see and hear everything.  The doctor tried to get me to sign a consent form and I remember thinking \"what are you doing you silly woman I cant even breathe let alone write\".\nThey asked my poor husband who they should save me or our unborn daughter! That question haunted me for weeks afterwards.\n\nI was now in a coma.\nMy husband was told that I wouldn't survive and our daughter was taken out quickly in an operation as her heart rate had dropped. I was being kept alive by a machine.\n\nMy mum and dad had started attending a church and when my husband rang them they asked their church to pray. He also got down on his knees and said \"if you are there God now is the time to show up. I will do anything if you save my wife\".\nAt that moment when they and he prayed I opened my eyes. I was in intensive care in a room on my own with my own individual specialist nurse and the blinds drawn.  The nurse watching over me jumped as I spoke. My community midwife was holding my hand crying. I was confused but still understood that it was unusual for her to be there. She told me when she got the call she repeated all the way to the hospital \"please don't let it be Rowena, please don't let it be Rowena\" because she knew how afraid I was beforehand.\nRon and our families were allowed in and they all cried. I didn't – I was in deep shock, fear and pain. The doctors kept coming in and telling me repeatedly that it was a miracle. Asking me if I understood it was a miracle? But I didn't at that moment.  Because I didn't know what a miracle was. I had never been to church, read the Bible or event met a Christian so the word miracle meant nothing to me!\nI was so traumatised I had a breakdown. I discharged myself from hospital on day 3 shaking from head to toe.\nThere began a horrific journey back to health just me, Ron and our beautiful baby Isabella. We ran away and bought a B and B.  I think we were trying to get as far away from the pain as possible. But you take the pain with you and are now hundreds of miles away from your family and friends. We clung to each other and our wonderful gift of a daughter who was a complete joy.\n\nWe moved to Devon and Ron heard a voice say “you have to buy that place” as we drove past a shop and B and B! he then did the boy thing and made me ring them and ask if they would sell it to us. The voice on the other end of the phone gave me many reasons why they wouldn't like to do that! I then heard a voice whisper to me \"leave your number\". So weirdly I did.\nPeople ask us if it was weird hearing the voice – but the weird thing was that it wasn't weird!\nSomeone rang us back 20 minutes later and asked how we knew they were thinking of selling. We told them we didn’t.\n\n6 months later we moved in and what God had done (without us knowing Him) was place us at the heart of a very Christian community. We were very open about why we were there and how much pain we were still in some days. But we noticed straight away that some of them who befriended us were different. We described them as having a light inside them that the rest of the world didn't have. We were drawn to them uncontrollably.\nThey showed us love and friendship but didn't seem to want anything from us. Being from London (and in advertising which quite frankly at that time was up there with estate agency for swimming with sharks!) there can be times when it felt like people are only nice to you when you are useful to them. These people were different.\nThey told us about Jesus – they actually tell it differently and say we bombarded them with questions.\nOne morning we woke up and said we wanted to go to church – God is super organised and it was a Sunday! So we went. We spent the whole service in floods of tears with no idea what was going on in this small rural church by the sea. But we described it as like we had \"come home\". To what we had no idea but we knew we had \"come home\".\nThe church put on an alpha course – pretty much just for us and there we found out more about Jesus and His love.\n\nAt the end we decided to give it a go – this Christian thing and we jumped in head first and said yes to Jesus. I will never forget Duncan the Baptist Minister telling me \"faith is not something you bolt on to your existing life Rowena.  It must become the centre OF your life from which everything else flows\".\nIt was powerful, the truth and has stuck with me ever since.\nWe were discipled and loved so well by that lovely little church by the sea. We started hosting a variety of things in the village and would tell anyone who would listen that Jesus loved them. We were on fire with His love. You see up until that point aged 34 – no-one had shared the Gospel with us.  No-one had invited us to church. We would actually say up until that point we had never met a Christian!!!!!! Which is of course a big fat lie.\nThe hard truth of it actually was that up until that point we were not valuable enough to be told the good news. We NEEDED it, we SEARCHED for it but no-one shared it with us. So if you are reading this and haven't heard it yet – here it is just for you my darling.\n\nJesus loves YOU. He is relentlessly pursuing a relationship with you. You are NOT your circumstances, you are NOT what you have done or what has been done to you. You are a beautiful child of God and He is waiting for you with open arms. I wanted to tell you that in case you had never heard. You see I promised Jesus that I would spend the rest of my life telling people how He loves them. 4 years later we left that village for my husband to start training as a Church of England Vicar! That is a Pastor if you are reading this elsewhere. Me the wife of a Pastor! Are you joking Lord? Have you not heard what comes out of my mouth. I am still way too naughty to be a Christian.\nBut you see Jesus doesn't look at us and see our mistakes oh no. He looks at us and sees our potential. He sees us as we really are. Not how the world thinks we are. He is always there with us. It is us who turn away from Him (or are never told about Him or aware of Him in the first place), not the other way round.\nSo for some of us who are not paying attention (me never!!!) He has to find us in a more radical way. I love the description CS Lewis gives which I read just this morning as I prepared to write this. So maybe its for you?\nHe said:\n\"pain is God's megaphone to rouse a deaf world\"\nNever a truer word has been spoken about our world – inattentive sleepy spirits.\nRon and I were completely deaf. But in our deepest and most debilitating pain God reached in and saved my life.  Not just physically – that was the easy bit! No He spiritually saved my life and took it from a temporary, plastic life to an eternal one to be spent with Him. What a gift. And I will be forever thankful that God used my pain for His good. And I will serve Him for the rest of my days in thankfulness to Him and our friends who took a leap of faith and shared His love with us. You are valuable to Him.",

    bodyText: "'He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, 'Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.' - Mark 9:35. This was part of one of my readings today and it was one of the greatest lessons I learned and am still learning about being in any form of leadership.\n\nI struggle with achieving it daily (oh let's be honest hourly) and I assumed it was because I am obviously a particularly selfish person. Which is oddly why I find Jesus' words so comforting in this passage. This verse is all about becoming a servant. Just like it says in Mark 10 (and Matthew and John such is its importance) where it says; 'For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,' Did I really hear that? Jesus came not to be served but TO serve. Gets me EVERY time. If Jesus was a servant then why on earth would I not be. Why? Because it is completely counter cultural and goes exactly against what the world tells me and you every single day of our lives at every turn. The world says you are king, be in charge of your own life, love yourself first, make yourself happy, make your own rules and be master of your own destiny - in other words be your own god in your life. But Jesus (knowing exactly what the disciples had been arguing about in Mark 9:33) tells us to do the opposite. In fact in most of Jesus' teachings He says a variety of versions of these messages;\nLove God first.\nLove neighbour.\nServe and not be served.\nBe last not first. \nTake care of the hungry, the prisoners the widows and orphans.\nNotice people.\nShare the Good News.\nWhich when you look at them side by side is the EXACT opposite of our self focused culture. That is why it was hard for disciples then and why it's hard for us today now. Jesus is asking us to swim against the tide. Just like this picture I found. But I really wanted to share this because maybe like me you get thwarted by thinking 'I bet everyone else finds this easy so I must just be particularly selfish'. Which then makes trying to do this so easy to give up on. But that is a LIE of the enemy. With the exact intention of paralysing us into doing nothing.\n\nBut Jesus KNOWS this about us and He loves us so He shows us the right way. Just like the light guiding the fish in the picture as it swims against the tide of people flooding towards him.\nSo I say today embrace the fact we are self centred sometimes but Jesus sees our potential and believes in us. We don't have to stay that way. We do make mistakes but with Jesus, His Word and the Holy Spirit there is NOTHING we can't do or change about ourselves. I find embracing my frailty strangely freeing today. So I encourage you today to Swim against the tide today whatever your tide might be. Whether it's friends, fear, work, family, pain or fear again call on Jesus and serve and not be served. The beautiful thing is that by seeking to be the least it will actually make you a giant in His eyes.",

    bodyText: "'A great wave of persecution began that day, sweeping over the church in Jerusalem; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria.' Acts 8:1.\n'But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went.' Acts 8:4.\n\nThis reading struck me like a lightening bolt. As a leader (reluctant or otherwise) it is usual to experience spiritual attack - a wise person once told me 'if you are not experiencing attack then you are not doing enough for Jesus!' Nowhere else in life have I experienced such a relentless plethora of 'helpful' hurtful comments, gossip and judgement by people. It's bizarre and hurtful in one. Worse still - some of them have truth in them!!!!  In Acts a huge persecution began (far worse than me or you will ever receive!!!!!) described hauntingly as 'a great wave of persecution'. This persecution provoked a natural human response - it caused the people to run, to scatter! How awful we think when we read it and rightly so. But what I LOVE is what God did with that. BECAUSE of the persecution the Gospel spread further than it ever would have without it. The good news was preached in places it may never had been. It says further on 'crowds listened' and there was 'great joy'. Evil spirits were cast out and the Holy Spirit came for the first time on people and believers sprung up all over the place. Wow, hurrah and boom. So the very opposite of what the enemy wanted - happened. Praise God. So for me I say bring it on. I will choose to learn from these painful judgements and criticisms and fight back by doing the very thing the enemy doesn't want me to do. I am going to ask God to help me try and change what I can in ME and leave the rest at the foot of the cross. Remember there is always a seed of truth in the enemy's attacks otherwise it wouldn't hurt you. Look for the seed of truth and DO something about it and throw away the rest and move forward. That way we learn and grow. We grow in behaviour, compassion and understanding. I CHOOSE to keep going even if I have to crawl there and do my small part in spreading the Gospel that is so desperately needed in our world today. So today what spiritual attack is happening to you? Are you going to lie down and give up? Or are you going to rise up and let God use the experience to mould you, refine you and strengthen you AND the Kingdom of God? Hold on to this verse in Genesis:\n'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good.'\nLearn from it, fight it with His Word and truth and get back up and fight on in the love and power of Jesus our loving Saviour who never gave up because He thought we were all worth fighting for. God WILL win.",

And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\"' Isaiah 29:13.\n\nI have been reflecting a lot since our recent conference for women. The Holy Spirit moved in a way I have never seen before. Chains were broken, hearts were fired up and the worship.........well it was joyful, individual and Spirit led and filled. As people have messaged me, emailed me and spoken to me since then the overriding comment has been 'we have to do it again'. All who were there have been left with a deep, deep hunger to be led by the Holy Spirit now - praise God. But all I could think was 'this is how church should be every week, every day!'. Not just a 'special' occasion. And I think this Bible verse sums up beautifully one of the biggest problems the church in the UK faces. Lukewarmity (yes I made that word myself!). Half in ness. In on my terms only. Religion bolted on to the hip of our otherwise worldly lives. Jesus follow me and not the other way round. Use whatever words you like or use these - His words \"These people say they are mine. They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\"\nWow harsh but true. How many of us go to church every Sunday (Or when we are not busy) and go through the motions. Love a good sing, like the familiarity of the words then leave unchanged and behave exactly the same? We rejoin the world. Lukewarm. The word lukewarm in the dictionary reads 'indifferent, half hearted, apathetic, Tepid' - woah!!! How many of us don't read our Bibles? You are not alone because a survey found that is 70% of Christians. How many of us show no visible signs of being a lover and follower of Jesus. Our heart is not in. Where is your heart today? Is it all in for Jesus? Do you work hard at that relationship? Or do you just follow your feelings? Feelings are powerful and overwhelming sometimes - I know that from my own experience. But the truth of God's love for us is powerful. The truth that He sent His Son to die for us is life changing. But He requires our whole heart. We are only here for a short time - with a unique mission given to us by God. Have you found yours yet? He is not a fad or a lifestyle choice He is THE Way the truth and THE life. He is not a list of man made rules and traditions. So I ask are you all in? Do you want to be a groundbreaking game changer in the place that He has sent you? Or are you content to be tepid? Today make a choice. Ask the Holy Spirit to come and be the leader of your life and watch that tepid become FIRE.",

    bodyText: "'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.' Genesis 50:20.\n\nThis is one of my favourite verses.  I find this verse so reassuring. Joseph went through SO much that would have tipped most of us over the edge but through it all he didn't seek revenge (even when the opportunity was handed to him on a plate), no, he saw how God had used his pain for good. He had compassion on his brothers because he had faith. He was able to see that God had used it to save so many people from dying. That wouldn't have happened had he just been happily living at home, being spoiled, untouched by pain. I admire Joseph's faith and I aspire to have a strong faith like Joseph, Daniel and all the other Bible hero's we read about. It takes real strength of faith to see and trust God in our pain doesn't it? When things aren't going the way WE choose. But I often see when I glance back over my life that my timing would have been awful and that actually His timing was perfect. I am now trying to seek God in amidst the pain, whilst it's happening (not easy at all I might add) instead of just afterwards looking back. By doing that I can ask Him \"what can I learn here Lord?\" A long time ago only a few years into the my faith I heard a sermon that changed my life. A man talked about his depression and how God had helped him realise his pain had a purpose. I cried throughout his sermon as it was like it was for me where I was right then. It felt like a giant weight had literally been lifted off me during the talk. I literally was freed from the chains of my depression. I hadn't been healed but I had been freed by the power of it over me. I just said \"wow if there is a purpose in this for You Lord then bring it on\". It has totally changed how I view it now when it creeps over me. What a gift from God. He helped me understand that He doesn't always heal the way WE want but he can ALWAYS use whatever it is for His purpose. For me that was a revelation and it was enough. And that is why I love this line so much. \"You intended it to harm me but God intended it all for good\". Boom it screams in the face of the enemy. It defiantly stands hands on hips in the truth of God's Word and His love and shouts \"do one satan\". It screams of faith and trust. It allows us to lift our eyes above our circumstances to the truth of God's love and promises that no matter what is happening He will use it for His good. It is so liberating to your faith to get to this point. It feels like braveheart flicking the bird to satan. Not a very pc statement but raaaaaah!\n\"You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good\". And let's not forget the last bit of that Bible verse \"He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people\". Your journey will bless others. It will give more than it takes. For me it gave and continues to enable me to see others in pain and try and be compassionate (still learning though!). How many people have you seen whose ministry has evolved from the ashes of pain? Most of them actually. That's what the preacher did for me. He allowed God to turn his mess into His messsge and for that I will be forever grateful. He taught me courage, bravery and the power of sharing your brokenness. I wouldn't be who I am with out that beautiful intervention from God through an unlikely person who obeyed God in that moment and made himself vulnerable. We can all be Josephs if we choose to. What do you choose today?",

    bodyText: "\"In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches. But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. And among all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself. People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, but no one can tame the tongue. It is restless and evil, full of deadly poison. Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right! Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water? Does a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and you can't draw fresh water from a salty spring\". James 3:5-12.\n\nWow!!!!\nAs someone who does more and more public speaking as part of my calling this is particularly poignant. My huge desire is to be obedient and authentic to Jesus. But God is asking me to use my mouth - the very thing I have spent most of my life not liking. I have been told many, many times negatively at school and beyond that I talk to much (I am still working on that). It is actually something I feel shame about (another revelation from God this year). As a chatterer I often react rather than pause, breathe and think. I am full of passion for Jesus but the flip side of that is that I am full of \"passion\" when people hurt me or upset me. This verse is absolutely right. The same mouth that preaches also gossips. The same mouth that preaches also shouts in anger. In this verse James says that if we could control the tongue we would be perfect - but we are not! It says \"Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right\"\nThis is SO true. We can worship God one minute and gossip about someone the next out of the same mouth. Wow. When I think of it like that I am convicted. It sounds ugly. As an external processor gossip is always going to be a challenge but it doesn't make it acceptable. We dress up gossip in all sorts of clothes don't we? Processing, offloading and sometimes just fun with a friend? Ugly isn't it now I have said it. But what fire do we start with that judgemental dig? How far will that fire spread? Do I want to be known for spreading the Gospel or gossip? Errrrrr Gospel absolutely. My passion makes this particularly dangerous for me. So what can we do? Well we can take our brother or sister to one side privately and tell them they hurt us. Awkward yes but we both leave the conversation with a deeper connection because we did. The tongue can also destroy trust. In a moment trust can be gone. Boom the enemy wins. But if we talk to each other then anger may not build up and trust may not be broken. For me I find this really hard. My desire for justice (anyone else have this?) takes over when I have been wronged rather than trusting Gods justice and reconciliation. So I have been having conflict communication coaching (that was fun and ironically made me angry). You see what God helped me realise is that I can't change what others do or say to me but I CAN change how I react. And I want to be convicted by God's Word and I want to be changed by it and become more Christlike. So that means I have to actually respond to God's Word and change my behaviour (which is super hard and painful). But that way when I stand up and preach the Gospel I will have integrity and there will be no distraction from the beautiful truth of His love. And yes that also means I will have what comes with that which is maybe public brokenness too. But that is ok because the alternative is a slick, fake version of myself and that is NOT the true Gospel and Gods Word. I am not perfect or anything close but I thought I would share my revelation in case anyone else too feels this way today. There is hope in His Word. We do not have to stay the way we have become we can change in His love and in His strength. So today which will your tongue do? Bring the fire of the Gospel or a spark of destruction?",

    bodyText: "\"No, do not be afraid of those nations, for the Lord your God is among you, and he is a great and awesome God. The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals would multiply too quickly for you.\" Deuteronomy 7:21-22.\nWow this line jumped out at me from our \"read Scripture Bible in a year\" reading today. Why? Because I think it explains beautifully why God doesn't always answer our difficulties in our timing. In this passage it is Moses speaking reminding the whole community of what has just happened to them and why. He asks them to remember Gods words. I think it is a beautiful book as it squishes together all God's love for them and us and His warnings too. Moses when he wrote this knew he wasn't actually going to make it to the promised land (think how hard that must have been for him) but he STILL listened to God and brought Gods words of encouragement to the people. A people who had moaned, rebelled, doubted, caused trouble and moaned again all the way (imagine 'are we there yet' from a toddler in a car on steroids!!!). Yet still God was with them. And still He wanted them to know that sometimes He doesn't answer our cries with our will as it's not what's best for us. He can see round the corner and like any good parent He wants the best for us. The best for us is not always our will. He knows this will be an age old question we will keep asking so He gives us an example to hold on to;\n\"The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals would multiply too quickly for you.\"\nLittle by little.......otherwise wild animals will multiply too quickly for you.\nSomething you can't see will happen that will be so dangerous for you and worse than what you are feeling now. So God says because I love you so much I am protecting you from it. So today if you doubt or are afraid or are wondering why God hasn't answered your cry in your timing - take heart from this beautiful promise and stand strong in the truth of His words and promises for you.",

    bodyText: "\"I know all the things you do, that you are neither hot nor cold. I wish that you were one or the other!\" Revelation 3:15.\n\nWow! Just reflect on this question - am I lukewarm?\nI am generally a very passionate person and that is generally a good thing but it does have its downside too. Currently I am in a honing place in life. I am spending time with God and He is shaping and moulding me for what is to come.  So I am reflecting a lot on who I am and who He wants me to be. I am starting to understand that my passion is a good thing not a bad thing. That God puts it in there to help me get stuff done and not give up when we get knocked by people or life. I believe He wants us all to have passion for Him and His Kingdom. But can we say we are all really on fire or are we luke warm? Which one are you today as it stands? I find it very eye opening that the following lines in Revelation say that we think we are rich and have everything we need but really we are poor and blind. Woah! I think that we get sucked into the world and being of it instead of just in it. We focus on amassing worldly gold instead of His gold. In Hebrews 12 it reminds us to keep our eyes on fixed on our destination rather than the journey. To keep our eyes on Him rather that others around us. So why is it that we don't have passion to serve Jesus? I think it gets \"stolen\" from us by disappointment, hurt, pain, life.....! So what has \"stolen\" your passion today? Who or what have you allowed to put out your God given fire? Do you need reheating? Maybe you need heating up for the first time? Then know that God’s fire is always available to you because you are loved and accepted - just as you are. But He wants us to DO something with that love. So today let's ask for God to send His Holy Spirit to renew our passion and in the words of Take That (how sad am I!) \"relight our fire\".",

    bodyText: "\"But Balaam replied, \"I will speak only the message that the Lord puts in my mouth.\" Numbers 23:12.\n\"Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place—until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines in your hearts. Above all, you must realize that no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding, or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.\" 2 Peter 1:19-21.\n\nLove these two readings - the first really struck me in numbers because the bloke saying it repeatedly says \"I will only speak what God puts in my mouth.\" It's beautiful because He seeks God over and over and God repeatedly shows up and uses him. He is being tempted by a dodgy king but he says I can only speak what God puts in my mouth. He isn't perfect though and in his desire to follow God he gets it wrong too and God uses a talking donkey to get his attention!!!!! How cool is that - but the reason I have shared this is that my desire is only to speak words that God places in my mouth. But I am nowhere near that yet. I know that humanly speaking that is very, very hard (especially as it's me a major oversharer!) but it is my deep desire. You see with all the speaking I do it would be really easy to slip into my own desire and that would be disastrous. So why the other reading too? Because it struck me it was saying the same thing. It says none of the wonderful things prophesied in the Bible came from human speaking they were all \"moved by the Holy Spirit and spoke from God\". Hurrah. So when God uses people in the Bible He equips them and gives them His words. He doesn't expect us to know everything and have all the answers. He just expects us to seek Him and His will. How do we do that? Well the answer is right there in the reading \"you must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place\". Wow, I defo need a lamp shining for me. Sometimes my mind takes me to a very dark place. But His Word always brings me out even if it's just temporarily. Learn to hear God's voice and see His lamp unto your feet. Take heart knowing He goes into difficult situations with us and gives us the right words when we have none. He will use us for His glory if we let Him.",

A heavy heart at the state of our country and how far we have gone away from our loving God. Recently I posted an article about the Ashers bakery case and got slightly judged and accused of being homophobic. Which I find deeply offensive. I have never and pray I will ever hate anyone. I can take that I am a big girl but what I couldn't take was the consistent attacks on our loving Father, the attempts at watering down the Bible and the subtle but very real attempt to airbrush Jesus out of our society and silence Christian voices and faith in our country - and we are letting it happen. I went to bed with an genuine aching heart. I then got up and this verse was one of my readings. How beautiful and how sad. I think it's encouragement to keep going. Encouragement to keep speaking out for Him with love (definitely not with hate). The world needs Jesus and we are His hands and feet. We are the only way some people will encounter Him by seeing Him in us. So if you see something dissing Him then stand up and speak out with love. Pray then speak. Use your Bible, His Word, to help you. Don't just write it off as social media nonsense it is very real. A subtle erosion of faith in our society. We have an audience of One at the end of the day. Stand up for the One who loves you more deeply than you will ever know. \"But as he came closer to Jerusalem and saw the city ahead, he began to weep.\"\nLet Him not weep on our watch.",
