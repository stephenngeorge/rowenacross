    bodyText: "'He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, 'Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.' - Mark 9:35. This was part of one of my readings today and it was one of the greatest lessons I learned and am still learning about being in any form of leadership.\n\nI struggle with achieving it daily (oh let's be honest hourly) and I assumed it was because I am obviously a particularly selfish person. Which is oddly why I find Jesus' words so comforting in this passage. This verse is all about becoming a servant. Just like it says in Mark 10 (and Matthew and John such is its importance) where it says; 'For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,' Did I really hear that? Jesus came not to be served but TO serve. Gets me EVERY time. If Jesus was a servant then why on earth would I not be. Why? Because it is completely counter cultural and goes exactly against what the world tells me and you every single day of our lives at every turn. The world says you are king, be in charge of your own life, love yourself first, make yourself happy, make your own rules and be master of your own destiny - in other words be your own god in your life. But Jesus (knowing exactly what the disciples had been arguing about in Mark 9:33) tells us to do the opposite. In fact in most of Jesus' teachings He says a variety of versions of these messages;\nLove God first.\nLove neighbour.\nServe and not be served.\nBe last not first. \nTake care of the hungry, the prisoners the widows and orphans.\nNotice people.\nShare the Good News.\nWhich when you look at them side by side is the EXACT opposite of our self focused culture. That is why it was hard for disciples then and why it's hard for us today now. Jesus is asking us to swim against the tide. Just like this picture I found. But I really wanted to share this because maybe like me you get thwarted by thinking 'I bet everyone else finds this easy so I must just be particularly selfish'. Which then makes trying to do this so easy to give up on. But that is a LIE of the enemy. With the exact intention of paralysing us into doing nothing.\n\nBut Jesus KNOWS this about us and He loves us so He shows us the right way. Just like the light guiding the fish in the picture as it swims against the tide of people flooding towards him.\nSo I say today embrace the fact we are self centred sometimes but Jesus sees our potential and believes in us. We don't have to stay that way. We do make mistakes but with Jesus, His Word and the Holy Spirit there is NOTHING we can't do or change about ourselves. I find embracing my frailty strangely freeing today. So I encourage you today to Swim against the tide today whatever your tide might be. Whether it's friends, fear, work, family, pain or fear again call on Jesus and serve and not be served. The beautiful thing is that by seeking to be the least it will actually make you a giant in His eyes.",

    bodyText: "'A great wave of persecution began that day, sweeping over the church in Jerusalem; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria.' Acts 8:1.\n'But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went.' Acts 8:4.\n\nThis reading struck me like a lightening bolt. As a leader (reluctant or otherwise) it is usual to experience spiritual attack - a wise person once told me 'if you are not experiencing attack then you are not doing enough for Jesus!' Nowhere else in life have I experienced such a relentless plethora of 'helpful' hurtful comments, gossip and judgement by people. It's bizarre and hurtful in one. Worse still - some of them have truth in them!!!!  In Acts a huge persecution began (far worse than me or you will ever receive!!!!!) described hauntingly as 'a great wave of persecution'. This persecution provoked a natural human response - it caused the people to run, to scatter! How awful we think when we read it and rightly so. But what I LOVE is what God did with that. BECAUSE of the persecution the Gospel spread further than it ever would have without it. The good news was preached in places it may never had been. It says further on 'crowds listened' and there was 'great joy'. Evil spirits were cast out and the Holy Spirit came for the first time on people and believers sprung up all over the place. Wow, hurrah and boom. So the very opposite of what the enemy wanted - happened. Praise God. So for me I say bring it on. I will choose to learn from these painful judgements and criticisms and fight back by doing the very thing the enemy doesn't want me to do. I am going to ask God to help me try and change what I can in ME and leave the rest at the foot of the cross. Remember there is always a seed of truth in the enemy's attacks otherwise it wouldn't hurt you. Look for the seed of truth and DO something about it and throw away the rest and move forward. That way we learn and grow. We grow in behaviour, compassion and understanding. I CHOOSE to keep going even if I have to crawl there and do my small part in spreading the Gospel that is so desperately needed in our world today. So today what spiritual attack is happening to you? Are you going to lie down and give up? Or are you going to rise up and let God use the experience to mould you, refine you and strengthen you AND the Kingdom of God? Hold on to this verse in Genesis:\n'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good.'\nLearn from it, fight it with His Word and truth and get back up and fight on in the love and power of Jesus our loving Saviour who never gave up because He thought we were all worth fighting for. God WILL win.",

    bodyText: "'And so the Lord says, \"These people say they are mine. They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\"' Isaiah 29:13.\n\nI have been reflecting a lot since our recent conference for women. The Holy Spirit moved in a way I have never seen before. Chains were broken, hearts were fired up and the worship.........well it was joyful, individual and Spirit led and filled. As people have messaged me, emailed me and spoken to me since then the overriding comment has been 'we have to do it again'. All who were there have been left with a deep, deep hunger to be led by the Holy Spirit now - praise God. But all I could think was 'this is how church should be every week, every day!'. Not just a 'special' occasion. And I think this Bible verse sums up beautifully one of the biggest problems the church in the UK faces. Lukewarmity (yes I made that word myself!). Half in ness. In on my terms only. Religion bolted on to the hip of our otherwise worldly lives. Jesus follow me and not the other way round. Use whatever words you like or use these - His words \"These people say they are mine. They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\"\nWow harsh but true. How many of us go to church every Sunday (Or when we are not busy) and go through the motions. Love a good sing, like the familiarity of the words then leave unchanged and behave exactly the same? We rejoin the world. Lukewarm. The word lukewarm in the dictionary reads 'indifferent, half hearted, apathetic, Tepid' - woah!!! How many of us don't read our Bibles? You are not alone because a survey found that is 70% of Christians. How many of us show no visible signs of being a lover and follower of Jesus. Our heart is not in. Where is your heart today? Is it all in for Jesus? Do you work hard at that relationship? Or do you just follow your feelings? Feelings are powerful and overwhelming sometimes - I know that from my own experience. But the truth of God's love for us is powerful. The truth that He sent His Son to die for us is life changing. But He requires our whole heart. We are only here for a short time - with a unique mission given to us by God. Have you found yours yet? He is not a fad or a lifestyle choice He is THE Way the truth and THE life. He is not a list of man made rules and traditions. So I ask are you all in? Do you want to be a groundbreaking game changer in the place that He has sent you? Or are you content to be tepid? Today make a choice. Ask the Holy Spirit to come and be the leader of your life and watch that tepid become FIRE.",

    bodyText: "'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.' Genesis 50:20.\n\nThis is one of my favourite verses.  I find this verse so reassuring. Joseph went through SO much that would have tipped most of us over the edge but through it all he didn't seek revenge (even when the opportunity was handed to him on a plate), no, he saw how God had used his pain for good. He had compassion on his brothers because he had faith. He was able to see that God had used it to save so many people from dying. That wouldn't have happened had he just been happily living at home, being spoiled, untouched by pain. I admire Joseph's faith and I aspire to have a strong faith like Joseph, Daniel and all the other Bible hero's we read about. It takes real strength of faith to see and trust God in our pain doesn't it? When things aren't going the way WE choose. But I often see when I glance back over my life that my timing would have been awful and that actually His timing was perfect. I am now trying to seek God in amidst the pain, whilst it's happening (not easy at all I might add) instead of just afterwards looking back. By doing that I can ask Him \"what can I learn here Lord?\" A long time ago only a few years into the my faith I heard a sermon that changed my life. A man talked about his depression and how God had helped him realise his pain had a purpose. I cried throughout his sermon as it was like it was for me where I was right then. It felt like a giant weight had literally been lifted off me during the talk. I literally was freed from the chains of my depression. I hadn't been healed but I had been freed by the power of it over me. I just said \"wow if there is a purpose in this for You Lord then bring it on\". It has totally changed how I view it now when it creeps over me. What a gift from God. He helped me understand that He doesn't always heal the way WE want but he can ALWAYS use whatever it is for His purpose. For me that was a revelation and it was enough. And that is why I love this line so much. \"You intended it to harm me but God intended it all for good\". Boom it screams in the face of the enemy. It defiantly stands hands on hips in the truth of God's Word and His love and shouts \"do one satan\". It screams of faith and trust. It allows us to lift our eyes above our circumstances to the truth of God's love and promises that no matter what is happening He will use it for His good. It is so liberating to your faith to get to this point. It feels like braveheart flicking the bird to satan. Not a very pc statement but raaaaaah!\n\"You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good\". And let's not forget the last bit of that Bible verse \"He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people\". Your journey will bless others. It will give more than it takes. For me it gave and continues to enable me to see others in pain and try and be compassionate (still learning though!). How many people have you seen whose ministry has evolved from the ashes of pain? Most of them actually. That's what the preacher did for me. He allowed God to turn his mess into His messsge and for that I will be forever grateful. He taught me courage, bravery and the power of sharing your brokenness. I wouldn't be who I am with out that beautiful intervention from God through an unlikely person who obeyed God in that moment and made himself vulnerable. We can all be Josephs if we choose to. What do you choose today?",

    bodyText: "\"In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches. But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire. And among all the parts of the body, the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself. People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish, but no one can tame the tongue. It is restless and evil, full of deadly poison. Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right! Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water? Does a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and you can't draw fresh water from a salty spring\". James 3:5-12.\n\nWow!!!!\nAs someone who does more and more public speaking as part of my calling this is particularly poignant. My huge desire is to be obedient and authentic to Jesus. But God is asking me to use my mouth - the very thing I have spent most of my life not liking. I have been told many, many times negatively at school and beyond that I talk to much (I am still working on that). It is actually something I feel shame about (another revelation from God this year). As a chatterer I often react rather than pause, breathe and think. I am full of passion for Jesus but the flip side of that is that I am full of \"passion\" when people hurt me or upset me. This verse is absolutely right. The same mouth that preaches also gossips. The same mouth that preaches also shouts in anger. In this verse James says that if we could control the tongue we would be perfect - but we are not! It says \"Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God. And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right\"\nThis is SO true. We can worship God one minute and gossip about someone the next out of the same mouth. Wow. When I think of it like that I am convicted. It sounds ugly. As an external processor gossip is always going to be a challenge but it doesn't make it acceptable. We dress up gossip in all sorts of clothes don't we? Processing, offloading and sometimes just fun with a friend? Ugly isn't it now I have said it. But what fire do we start with that judgemental dig? How far will that fire spread? Do I want to be known for spreading the Gospel or gossip? Errrrrr Gospel absolutely. My passion makes this particularly dangerous for me. So what can we do? Well we can take our brother or sister to one side privately and tell them they hurt us. Awkward yes but we both leave the conversation with a deeper connection because we did. The tongue can also destroy trust. In a moment trust can be gone. Boom the enemy wins. But if we talk to each other then anger may not build up and trust may not be broken. For me I find this really hard. My desire for justice (anyone else have this?) takes over when I have been wronged rather than trusting Gods justice and reconciliation. So I have been having conflict communication coaching (that was fun and ironically made me angry). You see what God helped me realise is that I can't change what others do or say to me but I CAN change how I react. And I want to be convicted by God's Word and I want to be changed by it and become more Christlike. So that means I have to actually respond to God's Word and change my behaviour (which is super hard and painful). But that way when I stand up and preach the Gospel I will have integrity and there will be no distraction from the beautiful truth of His love. And yes that also means I will have what comes with that which is maybe public brokenness too. But that is ok because the alternative is a slick, fake version of myself and that is NOT the true Gospel and Gods Word. I am not perfect or anything close but I thought I would share my revelation in case anyone else too feels this way today. There is hope in His Word. We do not have to stay the way we have become we can change in His love and in His strength. So today which will your tongue do? Bring the fire of the Gospel or a spark of destruction?",

The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals would multiply too quickly for you.\" Deuteronomy 7:21-22.\nWow this line jumped out at me from our \"read Scripture Bible in a year\" reading today. Why? Because I think it explains beautifully why God doesn't always answer our difficulties in our timing. In this passage it is Moses speaking reminding the whole community of what has just happened to them and why. He asks them to remember Gods words. I think it is a beautiful book as it squishes together all God's love for them and us and His warnings too. Moses when he wrote this knew he wasn't actually going to make it to the promised land (think how hard that must have been for him) but he STILL listened to God and brought Gods words of encouragement to the people. A people who had moaned, rebelled, doubted, caused trouble and moaned again all the way (imagine 'are we there yet' from a toddler in a car on steroids!!!). Yet still God was with them. And still He wanted them to know that sometimes He doesn't answer our cries with our will as it's not what's best for us. He can see round the corner and like any good parent He wants the best for us. The best for us is not always our will. He knows this will be an age old question we will keep asking so He gives us an example to hold on to;\n\"The Lord your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals would multiply too quickly for you.\"\nLittle by little.......otherwise wild animals will multiply too quickly for you.\nSomething you can't see will happen that will be so dangerous for you and worse than what you are feeling now. So God says because I love you so much I am protecting you from it. So today if you doubt or are afraid or are wondering why God hasn't answered your cry in your timing - take heart from this beautiful promise and stand strong in the truth of His words and promises for you.",
