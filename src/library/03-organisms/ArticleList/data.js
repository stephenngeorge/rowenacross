    bodyText: "'He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, 'Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else.' - Mark 9:35. This was part of one of my readings today and it was one of the greatest lessons I learned and am still learning about being in any form of leadership.\n\nI struggle with achieving it daily (oh let's be honest hourly) and I assumed it was because I am obviously a particularly selfish person. Which is oddly why I find Jesus' words so comforting in this passage. This verse is all about becoming a servant. Just like it says in Mark 10 (and Matthew and John such is its importance) where it says; 'For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve,' Did I really hear that? Jesus came not to be served but TO serve. Gets me EVERY time. If Jesus was a servant then why on earth would I not be. Why? Because it is completely counter cultural and goes exactly against what the world tells me and you every single day of our lives at every turn. The world says you are king, be in charge of your own life, love yourself first, make yourself happy, make your own rules and be master of your own destiny - in other words be your own god in your life. But Jesus (knowing exactly what the disciples had been arguing about in Mark 9:33) tells us to do the opposite. In fact in most of Jesus' teachings He says a variety of versions of these messages;\nLove God first.\nLove neighbour.\nServe and not be served.\nBe last not first. \nTake care of the hungry, the prisoners the widows and orphans.\nNotice people.\nShare the Good News.\nWhich when you look at them side by side is the EXACT opposite of our self focused culture. That is why it was hard for disciples then and why it's hard for us today now. Jesus is asking us to swim against the tide. Just like this picture I found. But I really wanted to share this because maybe like me you get thwarted by thinking 'I bet everyone else finds this easy so I must just be particularly selfish'. Which then makes trying to do this so easy to give up on. But that is a LIE of the enemy. With the exact intention of paralysing us into doing nothing.\n\nBut Jesus KNOWS this about us and He loves us so He shows us the right way. Just like the light guiding the fish in the picture as it swims against the tide of people flooding towards him.\nSo I say today embrace the fact we are self centred sometimes but Jesus sees our potential and believes in us. We don't have to stay that way. We do make mistakes but with Jesus, His Word and the Holy Spirit there is NOTHING we can't do or change about ourselves. I find embracing my frailty strangely freeing today. So I encourage you today to Swim against the tide today whatever your tide might be. Whether it's friends, fear, work, family, pain or fear again call on Jesus and serve and not be served. The beautiful thing is that by seeking to be the least it will actually make you a giant in His eyes.",

    bodyText: "'A great wave of persecution began that day, sweeping over the church in Jerusalem; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria.' Acts 8:1.\n'But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went.' Acts 8:4.\n\nThis reading struck me like a lightening bolt. As a leader (reluctant or otherwise) it is usual to experience spiritual attack - a wise person once told me 'if you are not experiencing attack then you are not doing enough for Jesus!' Nowhere else in life have I experienced such a relentless plethora of 'helpful' hurtful comments, gossip and judgement by people. It's bizarre and hurtful in one. Worse still - some of them have truth in them!!!!  In Acts a huge persecution began (far worse than me or you will ever receive!!!!!) described hauntingly as 'a great wave of persecution'. This persecution provoked a natural human response - it caused the people to run, to scatter! How awful we think when we read it and rightly so. But what I LOVE is what God did with that. BECAUSE of the persecution the Gospel spread further than it ever would have without it. The good news was preached in places it may never had been. It says further on 'crowds listened' and there was 'great joy'. Evil spirits were cast out and the Holy Spirit came for the first time on people and believers sprung up all over the place. Wow, hurrah and boom. So the very opposite of what the enemy wanted - happened. Praise God. So for me I say bring it on. I will choose to learn from these painful judgements and criticisms and fight back by doing the very thing the enemy doesn't want me to do. I am going to ask God to help me try and change what I can in ME and leave the rest at the foot of the cross. Remember there is always a seed of truth in the enemy's attacks otherwise it wouldn't hurt you. Look for the seed of truth and DO something about it and throw away the rest and move forward. That way we learn and grow. We grow in behaviour, compassion and understanding. I CHOOSE to keep going even if I have to crawl there and do my small part in spreading the Gospel that is so desperately needed in our world today. So today what spiritual attack is happening to you? Are you going to lie down and give up? Or are you going to rise up and let God use the experience to mould you, refine you and strengthen you AND the Kingdom of God? Hold on to this verse in Genesis:\n'You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good.'\nLearn from it, fight it with His Word and truth and get back up and fight on in the love and power of Jesus our loving Saviour who never gave up because He thought we were all worth fighting for. God WILL win.",

    bodyText: "'And so the Lord says, \"These people say they are mine. They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\"' Isaiah 29:13.\n\nI have been reflecting a lot since our recent conference for women. The Holy Spirit moved in a way I have never seen before. Chains were broken, hearts were fired up and the worship.........well it was joyful, individual and Spirit led and filled. As people have messaged me, emailed me and spoken to me since then the overriding comment has been 'we have to do it again'. All who were there have been left with a deep, deep hunger to be led by the Holy Spirit now - praise God. But all I could think was 'this is how church should be every week, every day!'. Not just a 'special' occasion. And I think this Bible verse sums up beautifully one of the biggest problems the church in the UK faces. Lukewarmity (yes I made that word myself!). Half in ness. In on my terms only. Religion bolted on to the hip of our otherwise worldly lives. Jesus follow me and not the other way round. Use whatever words you like or use these - His words \"These people say they are mine. They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote.\"\nWow harsh but true. How many of us go to church every Sunday (Or when we are not busy) and go through the motions. Love a good sing, like the familiarity of the words then leave unchanged and behave exactly the same? We rejoin the world. Lukewarm. The word lukewarm in the dictionary reads 'indifferent, half hearted, apathetic, Tepid' - woah!!! How many of us don't read our Bibles? You are not alone because a survey found that is 70% of Christians. How many of us show no visible signs of being a lover and follower of Jesus. Our heart is not in. Where is your heart today? Is it all in for Jesus? Do you work hard at that relationship? Or do you just follow your feelings? Feelings are powerful and overwhelming sometimes - I know that from my own experience. But the truth of God's love for us is powerful. The truth that He sent His Son to die for us is life changing. But He requires our whole heart. We are only here for a short time - with a unique mission given to us by God. Have you found yours yet? He is not a fad or a lifestyle choice He is THE Way the truth and THE life. He is not a list of man made rules and traditions. So I ask are you all in? Do you want to be a groundbreaking game changer in the place that He has sent you? Or are you content to be tepid? Today make a choice. Ask the Holy Spirit to come and be the leader of your life and watch that tepid become FIRE.",
